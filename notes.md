1. Maybe we can update the work for instructions in a way, especially the implementation. For any reason, if a sub-agent fails completing the task due to context limitation, what would it do? If it fails to complete the work, given the constraint and limitation of size of the task, the orchestrator agent will then decide breaking that task into two separate parts and then delegating that.
